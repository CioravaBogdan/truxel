**If Truxel doesn't help you earn more money within 30 days, we'll refund 100% - no questions asked.**

Why? Because we KNOW this works. We've seen drivers go from â‚¬0 to â‚¬2,000+ extra per month within 60 days. We're so confident, we're putting our money where our mouth is.

**Try Standard or Pro for 30 days. If you don't find at least ONE new cargo opportunity that covers the subscription cost, email us and get a full refund.** 

*(Premium excluded from guarantee due to advanced features requiring longer onboarding)*
