# 🚨 FOUND IT! Here is exactly where to click

You are on the correct page! I can see it in the text you pasted.

Look at the bottom of your screen, just above "Public API Key".

You will see a section called:
**App-specific shared secret (Legacy)**

It is currently **collapsed** (closed).

## 1. Click the arrow to open it
Click the small arrow `v` or `>` next to **App-specific shared secret (Legacy)**.

## 2. Paste the Secret
Once it opens, you will see a text box.
Paste this code inside:
`45d310ca90494ce8bc04ed398f88d12d`

## 3. Save
Click **Save changes** at the very bottom of the page.

**Why is it hidden?**
RevenueCat hides it because they prefer the newer "In-app purchase key configuration" (which you already have set up with the P8 file). However, for the "Sandbox receipt" error Apple is seeing, setting this Legacy Shared Secret is the proven fix.
