## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Not for Active Use
Files in this archive are **historical records only**. For current documentation, see:

- **Technical Guides**: `../how_it_works/`
- **Quick Starts**: `../QUICKSTART.md`, `../START_HERE.md`
- **Project Summary**: `../PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
- **Changelog**: `../CHANGELOG.md`

### Why Keep Archives?

1. **Historical Context**: Understanding design decisions
2. **Learning**: See evolution of features
3. **Audit Trail**: Track what was done and why
4. **Recovery**: Reference old approaches if needed

### When to Add Here

Move documents to archive when:
- ✅ Feature is fully implemented and documented elsewhere
- ✅ Plan is completed and no longer active
- ✅ Checklist is 100% done
- ✅ Guide is superseded by a better version
- ✅ Script is one-time and no longer needed
