# Expo Go OAuth Fix

## The Problem
When using **Expo Go**, Google Login fails with one of two errors:
1. **"requested path is invalid"**: Happens when using the default `exp://` URL because it's not whitelisted in Supabase.
2. **"Something went wrong" (on auth.expo.io)**: Happens when using the Expo Proxy because it redirects to `truxel://`, which Expo Go cannot open.

## The Solution
We must use the default `exp://` URL generated by Expo Go and **whitelist it in Supabase**.

### Step 1: Get your Expo Go URL
1. Run `npx expo start --clear`
2. Scan the QR code with Android
3. Watch the terminal logs when you click "Sign in with Google"
4. Look for: `Computed redirectTo: exp://192.168.x.x:8081`

### Step 2: Whitelist in Supabase
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard > Authentication > URL Configuration**
2. Add the following to **Redirect URLs**:
   - `exp://*` (Allows all Expo Go connections)
   - `truxel://*` (For production/dev builds)

### Step 3: Restart
1. Restart the Expo server (`r` in terminal)
2. Try logging in again

## Alternative: Use Development Build (Recommended)
Expo Go has limitations with OAuth and Notifications. The best long-term fix is to use a Development Build, which supports the stable `truxel://` scheme.

1. Run: `npx expo run:android`
2. This installs a custom version of the app on your device/emulator.
3. OAuth will use `truxel://auth/callback` which is stable and already whitelisted.
